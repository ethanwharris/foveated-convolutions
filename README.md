Ethan Harris ([@ethanwharris](https://github.com/ethanwharris)), Mahesan Niranjan and Jonathon Hare ([@jonhare](https://github.com/jonhare))

## About

This repository contains the code for our paper 'Foveated Convolutions: Improving Spatial Transformer Networks by Modelling the Retina', accepted to the [NeurIPS 2019](https://neurips.cc/) workshop on [Shared Visual Representations in Humans and Machines (SVRHM)](https://www.svrhm2019.com/).

## Code

The main file for running experiments is `main.py`, uncomment the relevant sections to run different configurations.
ResNet experiments and the code to generate the figure can be found in `train_resnet.py` and `figure.py` respectively.
